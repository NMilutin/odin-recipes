        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to make oatmeal like a pro! It's truly one of the easiest (and fastest) healthy meals you can make. Enjoy a basic bowl of oatmeal or get creative with endless sweet and savory flavor options. I'll give you a few ideas and tips!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rolled Oats: These will create deliciously creamy porridge in just 5 to 10 minutes. Remember to buy certified gluten-free oats if you're gluten-sensitive or celiac.</li>
            <li>Water or Milk: For the liquid you can use water, milk or dairy-free milk (like almond milk or cashew milk), it's up to you! For that perfect level of creaminess, a 50/50 water and milk combo is great.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will transform a bland bowl of oatmeal into a flavorful one. Trust me, don't leave it out.</li>
            <li>Toppings: What's oatmeal without toppings? Have fun with spices, fruits, nuts, and so much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Just remember this ratio 1:2. For every portion of oats, you need double the amount of liquid. For a single serving with 1/2 cup of oats, that means you'll need 1 cup of liquid.</li>
            <li>Boil water. In a small pot, bring the water or milk and salt to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the oats. Stir in the oats then reduce the heat to medium-low. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes to let the liquid absorb, while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Top and serve. Add flavorful toppings, a drizzle of milk if you'd like, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
